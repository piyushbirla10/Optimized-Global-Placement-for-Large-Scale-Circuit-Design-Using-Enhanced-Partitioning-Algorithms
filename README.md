Optimized Global Placement for Large-Scale Circuit Design Using Enhanced Partitioning Algorithms
Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an optimized global placement solution for large-scale circuit design. Using an enhanced grid-based approach followed by improved partitioning algorithms, the project aims to provide efficient and accurate placement of components on a chip.

Key Features:
Grid-Based Initial Placement: Ensures systematic organization of components for subsequent optimization.
Enhanced Partitioning Algorithms: Improves upon traditional methods like Karger's algorithm to achieve better results for large-scale designs.
Efficient Computational Design: Utilizes advanced data structures and algorithms to handle datasets with thousands of components.
Visualization: Provides clear representations of placements for analysis.
Scalability: Handles datasets with over 3,000 components, ensuring applicability to modern circuit design challenges.

Background
Global placement is a critical step in circuit design, as it determines the initial layout of components on a chip. An optimal placement reduces wire lengths and improves the overall efficiency of the chip. This project addresses the inefficiencies of existing methods like Karger's algorithm by applying a robust grid-based placement strategy followed by enhanced partitioning.

Implementation Details
Step 1: Grid-Based Initial Placement
Components are placed in a uniform grid structure using a dataset with x and y coordinates (design.nodes).
Ensures even distribution and prepares the system for partitioning.
Step 2: Enhanced Partitioning Algorithm
Input: A netlist with IDs, component names, and coordinates.
Algorithm: Optimized graph partitioning techniques are applied, outperforming Karger's algorithm in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.
Outputs component groupings that minimize interconnections and optimize the layout.
Step 3: Output File
The final placements are written to an output file in the format:
txt

component_id, component_name, x_coordinate, y_coordinate
